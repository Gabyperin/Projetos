	 	<h2>Sobre a Universidade</h2>
	 	<p>
	 	Lorem <strong>Ipsum is simply</strong> simulation of text from the printing and <em>typesetting industry</em>, and has been in use since the 16th century, when an unknown printer took a tray of type and shuffled it to make a book of type designs. Lorem Ipsum has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap to desktop publishing, remaining essentially unchanged. It became popular in the 60's, when Letraset launched decals containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently when it started to be integrated into desktop publishing software such as Aldus PageMaker.

       <h2>Objetivos</h2>
	  	<p> 
	 	It is a known fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable text content of a page when examining its layout. The advantage of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <strong>"Content here</strong>, content here", making it look like readable text. Many publishing software and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default template text, and a quick search for <em>'lorem ipsum'</em>will show many websites still in their construction phase. Several new versions have appeared over the years, occasionally by accident, and sometimes on purpose (injecting humour, and the like).
